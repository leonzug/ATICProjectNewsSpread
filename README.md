Project about new spreading in society for Advanced Topics in Control Lecture, ETHZ


## For the instructors:
You can replicate the results of the paper (up to the randomness introduced in the process) by running the following scripts:
- Experiment about varying instruction level: "simulation_exp1.m"
- Experiment about varying society diversity: "simulation_exp2.m"
- Experiment about varying society manipulability: "simulation_exp8.m"
- Experiment about polarization: " ".
